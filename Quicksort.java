/**
 * Project 3 Description:
 * 
 * This project attempts to sort 4 byte records while minimizing disk I/O. To do
 * so, we implemented a buffer pool that is used as temporary storage. It
 * contains blocks with 1024 records each and uses a least recently used
 * strategy when the maximum capacity is reached.

     *            place in that file, so this program does modify the input data

     * 
     *            <numb-buffers> determines the number of buffers allocated for
     *            the buffer pool. This value will be in the range 1â€“20.
     * 
     *            <stat-file-name> is the name of a file that your program will
     *            generate to store runtime statistics; see below for more
